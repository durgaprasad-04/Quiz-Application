# Quiz-Application
MERN Stack Complete Quiz Application 
In this project, I have used  MongoDB, React, Express.js and Node.js for building a quiz application.
I have created a different folder for both the frontend (client) and the backend(server).

To run the project give cd PROJECT MERN.
cd quiz_app
cd client
npm run start
It will run the frontend .

cd quiz_app
cd server
npm run start
create the .env file and add port=5000 and ATLAS_URI="yours mongodb url"
It will run on the server port and connect to the mongodb.
